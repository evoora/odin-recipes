    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This tuna noodle casserole is the best with a classic creamy taste from my childhood. The sauce is rich and creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy.
         <br> The crunch from the topping and fresh bite from the parsley create the perfect balance. Let's not forget that this is a great budget-friendly meal to feed a crowd!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>4 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons salted butter, divided</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons olive oil, divided/li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken stock </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add egg noodles and 3 teaspoons salt to the boiling water; cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 6 minutes. Drain noodles. Return to pot and set aside.
                    </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion and cook until mushrooms are softened and onions are translucent, about 4 minutes. Add remaining butter; stir constantly until melted. Sprinkle flour over vegetable mixture and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Stir in milk and stock and bring to a simmer, stirring often. Simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add sauce mixture to reserved noodles. Stir in 1 cup Cheddar cheese, peas, and tuna. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish and sprinkle remaining Cheddar cheese over the top.

        </li>
        <li>Stir together bread crumbs, remaining 2 teaspoons oil, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and paprika in a small bowl. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture evenly over the casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</li>
